#### Folder Organization

 -  [htmls](htmls)   	  : Since the map outputs do not render on github, html output documents of previous successful runs  
         	    have been placed here as a demo.  
 - [scrap-code](scrap)     : Intermediate scrap code used in the eda for testing
 - address_list_x : These files are address from geo-tags in json format. Since most service providers restrict
       	   	  decoding geo to address api limits to ~ 2000 calls per day, the points have been extracted, grouped into 6 batches		        	 for decoding, and the decoded addresses have been cached as files
			  and kept in these files.
 - [co-ordinates](sample-coordinates) : Collection of points, which are analysed later in 6 batches
